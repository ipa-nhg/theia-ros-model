# Theia ros model repository

This repository contains the code to enable the use of [ros-model](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/) in a web interface. It is based on Theia and Sprotty (https://github.com/TypeFox/theia-xtext-sprotty-example).

## Start with Docker

```sh
[sudo] docker build --tag=theia-ros-model .
[sudo] docker-compose up
```

Alternatively to docker compose, the docker can be started with the command:

```sh
[sudo] docker run -p 3000:3000 -ti theia:latest
```
 
Open your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

A predefined workspace is provided to facilitate the use of the tool, click "File"->"Open Workspace" and select the folder ```home/theia/theia-app/ws```. There some examples of Ros models can be found

## Start together the theia web interface with the extractor engines

```sh
[sudo] ./setup_helper_with_extractors.sh
[sudo] docker-compose -f docker-compose_with_extractors.yml up
```

The extraction web will be available under [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/), the results of the analysis will be stored under the folder ```ws/results```. Openning the browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and using as workspace the default folder ```ws```. You can use the extracted models for composition and definition of systems.

:bangbang: :bangbang: We experimented some issues with the shared folder between the containers, sometimes we had to give manually access to the containers to the results folders. To do that you have to follow the following commands. First we need the ID of the containers:
```
docker container ls
```
Then we have to open a terminal within the containers for "haros_melodic", "haros_noetic" and "haros_foxy":
```
docker exec -ti IdForHarosDistributionContainer /bin/bash
```
And finally we have to set the rights to the results folder:
```
sudo chown -R extractor:extractor /home/extractor/results
```
## Current status:

The language server can be started successfully and the connection between the server and the theia app work. 

The following Xtext features are also available:
- Resolve of models and their attributes for .ros and .rossystem files
- DSLs rules validation, by displaying errors and warnings for the following cases:
    - the validation check for a node and package names
    - syntax such as wrong brackets or keywords)
    - cross-referenced element (such as the communication objects) cannot be resolved. 
- Auto-completation of cross-referenced elements


Apart of that a sprotty plugin allows the visualization of the .ros models

## Developer guide

### Update Xtext projects to be supported by Theia

The only projects required to run as backend the Xtext code are my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext and my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext.ide. For my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext the StandaloneSetup has to be updated to update the register function. The my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext.ide will hold the description of the diagram in case the model should be visualized. Apart of that and because of the needed dependencies the pom.xml files will need to be adjusted.

Once the changes are done, the projects have to be built and copied to the build folder of the theia extension. For our case the build is made within the Dockerfile (command RUN mvn clean package -f de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.parent) and the package.json file copy the .jar generatd file to the folder (see [theia/ros-dsl/package.json](theia/ros-dsl/package.json)).

:bangbang: For metamodels with cross dependencies (like rossystem with ros) the workflow (in mwe2 file) for the build of the DSL has to include the generator for the required model, see https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/blob/LanguageServer/plugins/de.fraunhofer.ipa.rossystem.xtext/src/de/fraunhofer/ipa/rossystem/GenerateRosSystem.mwe2#L47-L63 otherwise the cross references will not work.


In detail and for our concrete ros-model case, these are the required changes:

  When the language server is built with imported Ecore models (they are not inferred from the Xtext), the language URI has to be registered in the StandAlonSetup (`plugins/de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.xtext/src/de/fraunhofer/ipa/ros/RosStandaloneSetup.xtend`):    

```java
override register(Injector injector) {

		EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.put(RosPackage.eNS_URI, RosPackage.eINSTANCE);
		EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.put(PrimitivesPackage.eNS_URI, PrimitivesPackage.eINSTANCE);
		
		super.register(injector)
	}
```

- `theia`  
  A Theia app is composed of multiple *extensions* (see the [Theia documentation](https://www.theia-ide.org/docs/authoring_extensions) for a more detailed explanation). Currently there are two extensions: `ros-dsl` and `rossystem-dsl` for the `ros` and `rossystem` xtext languages respectively. Each extension has a `client` and `server` part (the code is located in the `browser` and `node` folders). 
    - for now, the node app takes care only of starting the language server (this can be seen in `theia/ros-dsl/src/node/ros-dsl-language-server-contribution.ts`). 
    - the browser part specifies the file extension, grammar configurations such as the keywords and adds an initial configuration for the diagrams
  
  In addition, in the `theia` folder there is also a project which contains the diagram configurations for the `ros` language - `ros-sprotty`

There are two options for the communication between the theia app and the language server:
- via standard input/output (this is the current version shown in `theia/ros-dsl/src/node/ros-dsl-language-server-contribution.ts`):
  ```const jar_path  = await this.getLanguageServerJarPath();
     const command = 'java';
     const args: string[] = [
            '-jar',
            jar_path
        ];

    const serverConnection = await this.createProcessStreamConnectionAsync(command, args);
    this.forward(clientConnection, serverConnection);
  ```
- start the language server as a socket server: this option is more suitable for debugging. To start it with Eclipse, create a launch configuration with `RosSocketServer` from the package `de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.ide.launch` as the main class. Afterwards start the theia browser app with `yarn start:debug` (for `rossystem` this is not implemented yet).

See [https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/pull/127](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/pull/127) to check all the required changes.

### Add Sprotty support

A new java package has to be added to the project my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext.ide, the recommended name for this new package is: my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext.ide.diagram. The default setup is composed by 5 classes:

- DiagramGenerator: this class define relations between the elements of the diagram. You have to implement there the functions about how to form the diagram with the information provided by the Xtetx models.
- DiagramModelElement: this class is not mandatory, there the developer can define custom elements designs (for the nodes, ports or edges). You can also opt for using the standard ones (SNode, SPort, SEdges)
- DiagramModule: standard class to override the default implementation add use the rest of the classes from this package
- DiagramServerFactory: In this class we define the type of the diagram, this has to be the same than the one expected by the frontend (for our case, under [theia/ros-dsl/src/browser/diagram/ros-diagram-configuration.ts](theia/ros-dsl/src/browser/diagram/ros-diagram-configuration.ts))
- LayoutEngine: in this class the layout can be configured (for our current code status, changes within this file doesn't affect to the diagram, probably because the frontend re-write it)

For the frontend part:

- The dsl extension some ts classes need to be developed. For our case we use the auto-generated standard version [theia/ros-dsl/src/browser/diagram](theia/ros-dsl/src/browser/diagram)
- A new theia extension for the Sprotty diagram is required [theia/ros-sprotty](theia/ros-sprotty). This extension contains:
  - css file for the style of the elements.
  - di.config.ts: this file containe the configuration of all the elements of the diagram. The name of each element has to corresponde with the name assigned on the backend (file my.awesome.project.dsl.xtext.ide.diagram/DiagramGenerator). Apart of that each element is configured by a model element type (default ones classes are https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty/blob/master/packages/sprotty/src/lib/model.ts) and an element view (default ones classes are https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty/blob/master/packages/sprotty/src/lib/svg-views.tsx)
  - model.ts: the developer can implement here new custom model element types (we are not using this on our current version).
  - views.tsx: the developer can implement here new custom element views. Not only the form of the element (rectangular, polygon, circle...) but also the layer position.

### Generate a language server from a Xtext project:

Tutorial: 

https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/may/article5.php

The language server can be generated with the option "Generate Xtext project from existing Ecore models". Example similar to the current configuration can be seen when running the wizard with the following options:

- preferred build system: **Maven**
- build language server: **Fat Jar**
- source layout: **plain**

------------------------

### Issues (partly out-of-date)

- Eclipse support for the dev version of ros-model


1. Install the Buildship Gradle Integration using the Eclipse Marketplace. Simply type Buildship and click on search item. Now click on Install.
2. Clone the repository https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-server.
3. Click on File -> Import -> Existing Gradle Project.
4. Navigate to project the root directory "sprotty-server". 
5. Click on a finish to load the projects.


- Diagrams:
Until now there are no diagrams (with the `ros-dsl` extension only the node is shown). Diagrams can be added using sprotty
(see https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty and the example above). Sprotty has a client and a server part; the current implementation of the server part is in the package `de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.ide.diagram`.

- Dependency Management (probably the biggest issue):

1. Creating a fat/uber jar  
   Running a standalone language server requires that the projects are packaged as a fat/uber jar which contains all the project dependencies. However, the standard plugins used in Maven for this ([Assembly](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/) and [Shade](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)) do not work in Tycho environment as Tycho resolves the dependencies using the system scope and they can not be picked afterwards by the plugins. The current solution uses therefore two additional plugins: `maven-dependency-plugin` with the goal `copy-dependencies` (this copies the dependencies into a `libs` folder inside the `target` directory of the project) and `addjars-maven-plugin` which copies the dependencies of the `libs` folder onto the classpath of the project. (This is also the configuration which can be generated automatically using Eclipse.) The second plugin, however, is old and not maintained anymore and has some issues such as [that it changes the base directory of the project after it is run](https://code.google.com/archive/p/addjars-maven-plugin/issues/8) which can make the addition of new plugins running in the phases afterwards difficult.

2. Adding external Maven dependencies to the projects  
  E.g. the framework with which the diagrams can be made, Sprotty does not have an Eclipse update site since it is a web framework not intented to be used in Eclipse. It can be found only in the Maven repositories and is therefore an external dependency since it cannot be added to the MANIFEST file. Specifying additional dependencies in the `pom.xml` file is not well supported by Tycho. The current solution uses therefore this plugin: https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin (see its documentation for a more detailed discussion on the problems of the dependency resolution). The main idea is that with the plugin a p2 site with the necessary external dependencies can be generated. The project which generates the site is `de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.externalDependencies`; it needs to be called with `mvn p2:site`. The updatesite is located in the target folder of the project and it can be uploded to a HTTP server. For testing puposes, it has been uploaded to http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/external-dependencies/. For development with Eclipse it is necessary to add this site to the target platform (menu Window > Preferences > Plug-in Development and afterwards by adding a Software Site (in some cases the opion "Install required software" needs to be unchecked).

	However, this does not seem stable: the dependencies are added as plugin singletons and they can therefore cause version conflicts when running the apps in Eclipse so they would have to be updated for each new version (? not sure if this is entirely correct but I noticed issues when I tried to launch the plugins). Furthermore, adding external dependencies to the projects also has implications for the the Eclipse feature. When the feature gets installled, Eclipse has to be able to find the necessary dependencies in the software update sites available in the installation. Therefore either the additional upatesite has to be added and enabled or the feature can be built including all dependencies (for further information on how to do this see Usage scenarios > Creating a self-contained p2 repository in https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/eclipse-repository). Example for the latter is the `de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.updatesite` project (also in the `ros-model` fork).


- Language keywords  
  Currently they are hardcoded in the file `ros-dsl/src/data/ros.tmLanguage.json`. A better solution would be to get these from the language server (see https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1095654/ for ideas how to do this) 


## Local setup (not tested for long time, probably will require updates)

Requirements:

- java8
- Maven 3.6.0: example instructions for the installation can be found [here](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-apache-maven-on-ubuntu-16-04), replace the version number with 3.6.0
- node 10: [installation using nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

Clone the repository recursively

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ipa-nhg/theia-ros-model
```

Build the language server 

```sh
cd ros-model
mvn clean package -f plugins/de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.parent
```

Start the browser app:

```sh
cd theia/
yarn --ignore-engines
yarn rebuild:browser
cd browser-app
yarn start
```

Open your browser on `http://localhost:3000`. 

The language rules apply to files with the extensions `.ros` and `.rossystem`. There are examples in the `theia/ws` folder in the repository.
